            <p>When the first pallet decoilers came on the market some years ago, 
              they proved to be a significant advancement. Now, an operator could 
              run an entire pallet of flat stock and the only downtime involved 
              is cutting the banding on the coil. No more &quot;up-ending&quot; 
              coils into place with a crane or hoist. Now one operator could load 
              30 coils of strip at one time. Even when running only a partial 
              coil, it was much safer to unload and reload a pallet then to manhandle 
              the coil.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the speeds and range of material that these units 
              could handle were limited. Most could not ramp up with a clutch-driven 
              roll former. Few could run faster then 100 ft. per min. None could 
              run material thicker then around 0. 060 in. With limited technology 
              and poor material control, pallet decoilers gained a reputation 
              for kinkig and distorting metal prior to processing. Although superb 
              in concept, pallet decoilers were anything but superb in the &quot;real 
              world.&quot; What would be done to solve this common problem? Had 
              pallet decoilers &quot;come of age&quot; to the point that the could 
              handle high demand applications? What about the ramp up time needed 
              for the mill and the speeds customers would require? Did anyone 
              have the technology to build a machine that could perform these 
              demanding operations?</p>

            <br>
            </strong>One company was looking for a pallet decoiler to work with 
            their roll former. The challenge was that the mill speed would run 
            in excess of 160 fpm and the material widths ranged from 3.5 in. to 
            22.125 in. Another consideration was the quick acceleration of the 
            mill. It was going to be tough to find a pallet decoiler to handle 
            the job. 
            <p>As is typical when searching for machinery that is unique, the 
              team leader had to embark on a &quot;search and find&quot; mission. 
              This involved much time and commitment as he relates, &quot;I was 
              placed in charge of finding the equipment. It seemed that no pallet 
              decoiler manufactuer could do what I requested, in fact, one company 
              even said that there was no way it could be done.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;We decided to attend the METALFORM '95 trade show to find 
              the corect machine.&quot; They saw a few decoilers available and 
              did not feel that they would be adequate. But then they found one 
              that looked promesing. &quot;Accra-Wire Controls (AWC) seemed to 
              have a design that showed some possibility. They said right from 
              the start that they would handle the job, but so did some other 
              companies. The difference was that they explained how they were 
              going to do it,&quot; he states. </p>
            <p>The high-torque, shaft-driven system that Accra-Wire Controls employs 
              provides stable operation, even in demanding environments.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;I was pleased that the engineering staff at AWC was willing 
              to work with us in designing something specifically for our job, 
              rather then stating either they could not do it, or that a standard 
              model would work.&quot; <br>

            What made it work? Constant tension. AWC has patented a tension control 
            system that helps them to handle highly specialized applications. 
            &quot;We can run material widths over 22 in. and loads up to 26,000 
            lbs. We have jobs running narrow strip with thicknesses in the 3/16 
            in. range and speed capabilities of over 200 fpm,&quot; says Johnnie 
            L. Jones, president and founder of AWC. &quot;We welcome the opportunity 
            to try a customer's material in-house to determine if we can run the 
            operation. We then will provide a personalized video for our customer 
            which we use to explain our ideas and means of doing the job properly. 
            This gives the customer an understanding of the machine they are considering. 
            <p>Summarizing the results of the pallet decoiler, the team leader 
              relates, &quot;We have experienced a 22 percent increase in production. 
              We use more of our shift running material rather than changing coils 
              and our parts have become more precise as the material tension is 
              maintained. We also have the added safety of not having to hand 
              load coils anymore.&quot; It took two operators to run the mill 
              before getting the AWC decoiler. They now look forward to reducing 
              that to one operator.</p>
            <p>AWC has proven their versatility with hard-to-handle applications. 
              <br>
              <br>
              But how can this technology assist the majority of manufacturers 
              working with standard materials and operations? Another case history 
              will prove informative. <br>

            Monty Brenner is a 33-year tenured plant manager at Pullman Industries, 
            manufacturers of automotive components with three plants in Michigan. 
            His challenge, as Monty said, &quot;was to increase production and 
            safety for my operators.&quot; <p>In his hunt for the solution, Monty 
              indicated &quot;all arrows kept pointing to pallet decoiling,&quot; 
              and he added, &quot;sometimes having more than nine coil changes 
              per day for each of the many roll form lines we have, there had 
              to be a better way.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;When I presented my challenge to AWC, it was apparent that 
              the technology they used in tesion control and coil handling could 
              really helps us. By using their decoilers, switching to larger OD 
              coils and making some changes in the roll formers' controllers, 
              we have been able to produce four times the amount of parts (most 
              of the increase came from the reduction in coil changing and the 
              use of larger coil Ods.) After running the lines it became evident 
              that we also going to save on labor costs. Now,one operator can 
              run two mills simultaneously.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              With the patented process AWC uses, the desire for increased production 
              is attained. Applying inertia formulas especialy formulated for 
              pallet decoiling allows AWC to mach the pallet decoilers to the 
              line speed and skid weights of the applications. <br>
              &quot;When dealing with increased weight and speed,&quot; explains 
              Paul Siegel, sales manager for Accra Wire Controls, &quot;you need 
              horsepwer, tension control and rugged construction in your pallet 
              decoiler. This allows you to power up and down (e-stop) with the 
              big loads.)<br>
              <br>
              Other design and operating features are worth nothing. Tension control 
              and quick acceleration/deceleration are based on AWC's electronically 
              controlled regenerative DC drive which eliminates the need for clutches, 
              brakes and maintenance. As the roll mill calls for material the 
              &quot;control arm&quot; senses the demand and will mirror the speed 
              required. The material then flows along its natural helix through 
              the giude rollers providing smooth decoiling. </p>
            <p>Containment of material that could be running over 250 ft./min. 
              is imperative. The mass of coils generates enormous inertia, which 
              makes necessary the &quot;table centering stem system&quot; that 
              AWC employs. It also prevents coil &quot;pigtails&quot; at the ID 
              from pulling off the top of or droping into the center of the remaining 
              coils, thus reducing the chance of damaging accidents.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Overall, it is clear that pallet decoilers have finally 
              &quot;come of age.&quot; The benefits gained through pallet decoiling 
              have shown that these units are cost-effective. Their versatility 
              now proves them to be practical for most stamping and roll forming 
              operations.</strong> <br>
