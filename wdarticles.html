            look when attempting to increase spring quality? <br>
            See how advanced payoff technology has turned the dereeler into an 
            essential component for boosting spring quality and production profitability.</strong><br> 
            <br>
            Perception. To perceive means to become aware of something through 
            the human senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste. 
            <p>But how often our perception is deceiving. For example, you are 
              traveling in an unfamiliar city when you become hungry. As you search 
              for a restaurant, what factors do you consider before entering? 
              Perhaps you quickly evaluate the cleanliness of the building's exterior 
              or how busy the establishment appears to be. What price range the 
              d&eacute;cor indicates might be another factor. Yet after all these 
              judgements calls, do you really know how good the food is or what 
              sort of service you will receive by that which you see from the 
              outside? It is our perception of a given situation that often dictates 
              our response. Frequently though, perception is wholly different 
              from reality. </p>
            <p>So how does this apply to the quality of springs? Well, if a spring 
              manufacturing facility discovered that the quality of one of its 
              parts was substandard, what areas of the production line would generally 
              be focused upon in determining the problem? Where would you look? 
              First, perhaps the coiler and the tooling. Second, the supplied 
              wire package and its consistency. Then, then maybe the straightener. 
              The normal perception is that these particular factors are the only 
              ones that matter to the maintenance and improvement of spring quality. 
              So what is the problem? </p>
            <p>The wire dereeler has often been viewed as having no positive effect 
              on production quality. Unfortunately, payoff performance is often 
              based only on whether the bearing on the &quot;Lazy Susan&quot; 
              is still allowing the table to turn. Although more and more companies 
              are beginning to see the benefits of working with powered dereelers, 
              most still seem to perceive that this kind of equipment has little 
              to do with quality assurance. The wire dereeler is usually the last 
              place one looks when striving for quality excellence. </p>
            <p>Should this be so? Is there any reason to consider the constant 
              tension dereeler available today? Are they a viable means of increasing 
              spring quality? Consider the following case history.</p></td>

            accident during a rainstorm. Today in Buffalo, NY plant, the company 
            manufacturers the majority of the springs used in wiper blades, worldwide. 
            <p>Spring quality is essential to the performance of a windshield 
              wiper blade. If the &quot;load&quot; is insufficient, the blade 
              will not have enough pressure to maintain contact with the windshield. 
              Conversely, if the spring exerts too much force on the wiper's &quot;arm,&quot; 
              the blade will drag across the windshield and cause &quot;chatter.&quot; 
              It is therefore imperative that the springs utilized in these wiper 
              blades are products made with stringent quality control. </p>
            <p>Approximately six years ago, Trico decided to look into methods 
              of improving production efficiency, as well as the level of quality 
              in the spring department. Management was sure that there had to 
              be a more productive, quality-orientated means of dereeling their 
              wire than the usual methods of cutting 20 to 40 pounds of wire off 
              the carrier and then running the material on a non-power swift. 
              As they searched for new methods of wire decoiling, they discovered 
              Accra-Wire Controls (AWC). </p>
            <p>Carl Dischner, Spring Department Supervisor, related, &quot;Accra-Wire 
              seemed to provide the best overall package for our needs. The machines 
              were innovative and the technology was better than we had seen in 
              any other payoff. The service they offered, along with the affordability 
              of the machines, made the decision clear for us.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Trico decided to try its first Accra-Botic dereeler, like the one 
              shown in at right, in 1990. The results were better than expected.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;The dereeler's ability to maintain a constant low tension 
              on the wire was the key to our quality improvement,&quot; continued 
              Dischner. &quot;With our old reels, the wire would be pulled forcefully 
              by the feed and then go slack. The constant inconstancy was causing 
              variances in our free lengths as well as our load deflection.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Constant tension is a necessary for proper decoiling of wire. As 
              noted with non-powered (and even many powered dereelers) wire tension 
              is not constant. This factor hinders the feed's ability to maintain 
              consistent feed lengths. In fact, according to Don Senko, Quality 
              Manager at Trico, the company attained 62% improvement in free lengths 
              and an 85% improvement in load deflection consistency by adding 
              constant tension dereelers.</p>
            <p>Senko explained, &quot;The extension spring with a formed hook 
              on each end is our primary type of spring. In our application, correct 
              alignment, of the hook ends is important since, if out of alignment, 
              it will place undue torque at the point of force thus neutralizing 
              the desired effect.&quot;</p>
            <p>How did the new wire dereeler affect this particular aspect of 
              quality control? Senko continued, &quot;The automatic (constant 
              tension) wire payoffs allowed us to achieve greater accuracy, reduced 
              variability, and reduced costs since we were able to control the 
              positions of the hooks and maintain uniformity in the back pitch.&quot;</p>
            <p> The Cpk Index Graph below illustrates improvement in quality for 
              four Trico parts as a result of installing automatic constant tension 
              wire payoffs.<br>
              <br>

              <br>
              Additional benefits were realized in the area of increased production 
              efficiency. By using these payoffs, Trico found that it had the 
              capability to place the entire carrier of wire on the dereeler. 
              With that arrangement, coiler downtime was minimized. As a matter 
              of fact, a single package of wire containing four shifts' worth 
              of process material is now loaded onto each of the company's 16 
              AWC constant tension dereelers.<br>
              <br>
              Moreover, labor savings were realized. &quot;We used to have six 
              people sorting springs to ensure quality,&quot; Senko said. &quot;Because 
              of the consistent quality we now maintain, we need only one person.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Overall, Trico has reduced labor cost by 60% to 80% in the spring 
              department. Another area of savings involves maintenance. According 
              to Senko, the company has seen a 40% to 70% reduction in tooling 
              maintenance since installing the new dereelers. <br>
              <br>
              In the analysis, Trico has increased its ability to cost effectively 
              produce quality springs. The simplicity of this new arrangement 
              has reduced labor costs and scrap, increased production, and enhanced 
              quality.</p></td>
