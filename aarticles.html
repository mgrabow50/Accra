            decoiler?<br>
            <br>
            </strong>A pallet decoiler is a coil handling machine that enables 
            the user to run coil stock on its side, or &quot;eye to the sky.&quot; 
            This style of decoiler allows the entire pallet of coils to be loaded 
            at once without the usual &quot;up ending&quot; and physical coil 
            handling associated with traditional decoiling methods such as mandrel 
            reels and coil cradles<br> <p> <img src="images/stamp2.jpg" width="147" height="80" align="left">Pallet 
              decoilers generally use some type of control point, ranging from 
              front and side dancer arms to control slide drums, to actuate the 
              drive system. In some instances, free-standing sensors are used. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Older versions of pallet decoilers were generally &quot;on/of&quot; 
              styles that reacted to a microswitch on a dancer arm. Modern designs 
              use some version of a variable-speed DC drive.</p></td>

          <td height="5" colspan="3" class="content"><strong>Advantages and misconceptions</strong><br> 
            <br>
            Pallet decoiling can help reduce press downtime associated with coil 
            changes, because it enables the user to place an entire skid of coil 
            stock on the platform at once. With less downtime, production rates 
            can be enhanced. Quicker changeovers also ensure that dies stay warmer, 
            reducing scrap and tool wear. 
            <p>Pallet decoilers also offer what is generally considered to be 
              a safe method of decoiling flat stock. Unlike traditional crane 
              and &quot;C&quot; hook loading, no manual coil handling is required 
              while loading a pallet decoiler. Back pain and abrasions are unlikely 
              when coil loading is done from a forklift.</p>
            <p>Misconceptions about pallet decoilers are common in metal-working 
              plants. Many believe that these types of uncoilers can be used only 
              for very narrow and/or thin material. Others believe that they are 
              capable of operating effectively only at slow speed or light loads.</p>
            <p>The new generation of pallet decoilers, however, is more versatile 
              then are the older styles. Decoilers now on the market can handle 
              material width up to 30 inches, although generally in thickness 
              under 0.050 inch. Some decoilers can run stock as thick as 0.187 
              inch.<br>
              <br>
              <img src="images/stamp3.jpg" width="160" height="80" align="left">Some 
              can handle speeds up to 400 feet per minute and quick-start roll 
              forming lines. Still others designs can accommodate loads in excess 
              of 25,000 pounds. </p></td>

          <td height="5" colspan="3" class="content"><strong>Applications:<br>
            </strong><br>
            Stamping presses are the most popular production machines used with 
            pallet decoilers. Most high-volume stampers go through hundreds of 
            coils of flat stock per month. Instead of stopping production for 
            up to 20 minutes for each coil change, they can now get their presses 
            back up in as little as two minutes. <p>With traditional coil handling 
              methods, a coil usually picked up off a coil stack either by a crane 
              or a &quot;C&quot; hook. In some instances, a coil would be placed 
              on an automated up-ender to turn the coil inside diameter (ID) horizontal. 
              The coil would then be either be loaded onto a mandrel reel or be 
              dropped into a coil cradle. Usually, changeover times for these 
              procedures range from 5 to 20 minutes.</p>
            <p>Other applications in which pallet decoilers may be useful include 
              four-slide and cut-to-length operations, which have similar downtime 
              and labor demands.</p>
            <p>New technology such as specialized controllers and high-torque 
              drive systems that some &quot;high-end&quot; pallet decoilers employ 
              have increased their capabilities in demanding environments. For 
              example, most consider that high-speed, clutch-driven roll formers 
              with their immediate acceleration are too demanding for pallet decoilers. 
              However, some pallet decoilers equipped with the new controls and 
              systems can be used in such capacities.</p>
            <p>An additional benefit for those running high-speed presses or mills 
              is that some pallet decoilers can handle coils with outside diameters 
              (ODs) as large as 80 inches, while many mandrels and cradles are 
              limited to the typical 48- or 60- inch OD coils. The larger coils 
              allow longer production runs between changeovers.</p>
            <p>In some instances, the reduction in coil changeovers allows one 
              operator to run several lines at once. One automotive supplier in 
              Michigan, for example, uses pallet decoiling with all 12 of its 
              roll forming lines in a new facility that has no mandrel reels, 
              cradles, cranes, or up-enders. The company also increased coil ODs, 
              began placing the coils at the lines rather than in a central storage 
              area, and purchased new mill controls. Now, each operator runs two 
              mills simultaneously, and production rates have jumped 400 percent.</p>
            <p>Progress is also being made in paying off heavy-gauge stock from 
              a pallet decoiler. This has always been the biggest drawback for 
              decoilers, because thick strip tend to have a great deal of &quot;clock 
              spring.&quot; And it is difficult to turn flat. Some pallet decoilers 
              now include features such as plane turners and coil containment 
              systems to combat the problem. <br>

            <br>
            Despite their advancements, pallet decoilers still have some inherent 
            limitations. One of the most confining is stock size, because running 
            stock wider than 30 inches or thicker than 0.250 inch is currently 
            not possible on a pallet decoiler. <p>Another potential drawback is 
              space limitations. Some newer pallet decoilers no longer require 
              a loop of material to properly decoil the stock. On lower-end models, 
              however, a loop of material is still necessary for proper decoiling, 
              possibly requiring more room than do reels or cradles.</p>
            <p>Finally, applications in which the user is constantly banding and 
              unbanding the coils for short production runs are not well suited 
              for pallet decoilers. When various strip widths gauges are run alternately, 
              double mandrel reels often provide quicker coil changeovers than 
              pallet decoilers.</p></td>

          <td height="5" colspan="3" class="content"><strong>Machine Features</strong> 
            <br> <br>
            It is a good idea to investigate several machine features before purchasing 
            a pallet decoiler. First, does the machine control material tension? 
            Maintaining the material tension throughout the decoiling process 
            reduces the chances of the kinking and &quot;pitting&quot; that often 
            occurred with earlier pallet decoiler designs. <p>The decoiler should 
              have properly rated acceleration and decel-eration times. This is 
              the time needed for the platform to accelerate to full speed from 
              a dead stop and to stop completely from full speed. If the decoiler 
              does not have a quick ramp-up build into its controls, the system 
              will fail to keep up with quick-start presses and mills. Conversely, 
              if the decelerating time is inadequate, the decoiler will not stop 
              quickly enough, and the coil stock will likely over-travel, creating 
              other problems. </p>
            Acceleration/deceleration time is closely linked to another important 
            consideration, power.<img src="images/stamp4.jpg" width="123" height="80" align="right"> 
            Every pallet decoiler application, regardless of the style of drive 
            or decoiling method, is governed by the laws of inertia.<br> <br>
            Overcoming the great amounts of inertia generated from heavy-load, 
            high-speed, large coil OD applications requires a tremendous amount 
            of horsepower. Some companies have developed computerized inertia 
            formulas to calculate the horsepower requirements based on the specifications 
            of the application. <p>The horsepower required is inversely proportional 
              to the acceleration/deceleration requirements. To illustrate, consider 
              an application that calls for a 1-HP motor with a four-second acceleration/deceleration 
              time. If the acceleration/deceleration time were increased 100 percent 
              to eight seconds, the horsepower requirements would be reduced by 
              50 percent to &frac12; HP. Conversely, if the acceleration/deceleration 
              time were cut in half to 2 seconds, the horsepower requirements 
              would double to 2 HP. </p>
            <p>A final consideration before buying is the type of drive with which 
              the decoiler is equipped. Generally, electric (DC) and hyghdro-static 
              drives are considered to be the quickest reacting. Pneumatic systems 
              are rarely used because they are generally regarded too &quot;jerky&quot; 
              and inconsistent for pallet decoiling. <br>

            manufacturing efficiency. No longer used only for very narrow or thin 
            materials, some of today's pallet decoilers can handle widths up to 
            30 inches, while others run thickness' up to 0.187 inch. Feed rates 
            of as much as 400 feed per minute are available. Pallet decoilers 
            may not be the best choice for short-production runs that require 
            frequent banding and unbanding of coils. For high-production applications, 
            however, pallet decoilers may provide an extra margin of efficiency.
